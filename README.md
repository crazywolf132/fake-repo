# Git Test Repository

A comprehensive fake repository designed for testing git-related tools, wrappers, and integrations.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a testing ground for developers building git-related tools. It contains a realistic project history with various git scenarios that your tool might encounter in real-world usage.

## Repository Features

### Branch Structure
- **21 branches** with different states and relationships
- Feature branches (`feature/*`) including stacked branches
- Bugfix branches (`bugfix/*`) including unicode names
- Hotfix branches (`hotfix/*`)
- Release branches (`release/*`)
- Orphan branch (`gh-pages`)
- Special test branches (unicode, long names, octopus merge)

### Commit History
- **Multiple authors**: 7 different contributors
- **Date range**: Commits spanning January-February 2024
- **Varied commit types**: features, fixes, refactors, chores
- **Merge commits**: Both fast-forward and non-fast-forward merges

### Complex Scenarios

#### 1. Merge Conflicts
- `src/helpers.js` has different implementations across branches
- Date formatting conflicts between `feature/user-auth` and `feature/database`

#### 2. File Operations
- **Renamed files**: `utils.js` → `helpers.js`
- **Moved files**: `database.js` → `core/database.js`
- **Binary files**: PNG image in `assets/`
- **Large JSON files**: Sample data in `data/`
- **Symbolic links**: Including broken links for edge case testing
- **File permissions**: Executable scripts with permission changes

#### 3. Branch Relationships
- Branches ahead/behind main
- Stacked branches (branches created from other branches)
- Divergent histories
- Cross-branch merges
- **Octopus merge**: 3-parent merge commit

#### 4. Advanced Git Features
- **Tags**: Annotated (`v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`) and lightweight (`v0.9.0`, `v1.2.0-beta`)
- **Git LFS**: Large file storage for `*.psd`, `*.zip`, `*.mov` files
- **Cherry-picked commits**: With `-x` flag showing origin
- **Revert commits**: Demonstrating revert history
- **Empty commits**: Testing edge cases
- **Git hooks**: Pre-commit and commit-msg hooks
- **Submodules**: Simulated submodule structure
- **Unicode branch names**: Testing special characters and emojis

## How to Use This Repository

### For Testing Git Wrappers

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/crazywolf132/fake-repo.git
cd fake-repo

# List all branches
git branch -a

# View the complex history
git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate

# Test branch operations
git checkout feature/user-auth
git checkout feature/database

# Test merge conflict scenarios
git checkout -b test-conflicts main
git merge feature/user-auth
git merge feature/database  # This will conflict
```

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Branch Analysis
Test your tool's ability to:
- List all branches with their status
- Identify branches ahead/behind main
- Detect merged vs unmerged branches
- Find branch creation points

#### 2. History Traversal
- Parse complex merge histories
- Handle multiple parents in merge commits
- Track file changes across renames
- Identify author contributions

#### 3. Conflict Detection
- Detect potential merge conflicts
- Analyze conflicting changes
- Suggest conflict resolution

#### 4. File Tracking
- Follow files through renames
- Track files moved to different directories
- Handle binary files appropriately
